description: How to deploy Vector into your own infrastructure
---

This section will cover deploying Vector. Vector is designed to deploy across
your entire infrastructure, serving both as an [agent][docs.roles.agent] and a
[service][docs.roles.service]. You combine these roles to form
[topologies][docs.topologies], enabling Vector to serve the simplest and most
complex use cases.

Start by becoming familiar with the [roles][docs.roles] and then take a closer
look at the [topologies][docs.roles] you can create.


[docs.roles.agent]: ../setup/deployment/roles/agent
[docs.roles.service]: ../setup/deployment/roles/service
[docs.roles]: ../setup/deployment/roles
[docs.topologies]: ../setup/deployment/topologies
